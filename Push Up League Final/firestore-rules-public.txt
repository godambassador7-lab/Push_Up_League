TEMPORARY PUBLIC ACCESS RULES (FOR TESTING ONLY)
================================================

⚠️ WARNING: These rules allow public read/write access. Use only for testing!
⚠️ Replace with proper authentication rules once you implement user login.

Copy and paste these rules into Firebase Console:

rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // TEMPORARY: Allow public read/write access for testing
    // This should be replaced with authentication rules in production

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }

    match /workouts/{workoutId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }

    match /achievements/{achievementId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }

    // Default deny all other collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}


STEPS TO UPDATE FIREBASE SECURITY RULES:
=========================================

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/

2. Select your project: "push-up-league"

3. In the left sidebar, click "Firestore Database"

4. Click the "Rules" tab at the top

5. Replace the existing rules with the rules above

6. Click "Publish" to save the changes

7. Wait 1-2 minutes for the rules to propagate

8. Refresh your GitHub Pages site and test the functionality


IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

These rules are TEMPORARY for testing purposes only. They allow anyone to read
and write data to your Firestore database.

For production use, you should:
1. Implement user authentication (email/password or Google sign-in)
2. Use the secure rules from firestore.rules file instead
3. Require users to be logged in before accessing their data

The app already has Firebase Auth code (see src/lib/firebase.ts), but the UI
doesn't enforce login yet. You can add a login screen later for better security.
